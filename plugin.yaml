  # The init command runs in the Application source directory at the beginning of each manifest generation. The init
  # command can output anything. A non-zero status code will fail manifest generation.
  init:
    # Init always happens immediately before generate, but its output is not treated as manifests.
    # This is a good place to, for example, download chart dependencies.
    command: [sh]
    args: [-c, 'echo "Initializing..."']
  # The generate command runs in the Application source directory each time manifests are generated. Standard output
  # must be ONLY valid Kubernetes Objects in either YAML or JSON. A non-zero exit code will fail manifest generation.
  # To write log messages from the command, write them to stderr, it will always be displayed.
  # Error output will be sent to the UI, so avoid printing sensitive information (such as secrets).
